# Customer-Churn-Analysis
Predictive Analysis of Customer Churn for a Subscription Service 
Project Objective: 
Develop a predictive model that identifies customers at high risk of churning from a subscription
based service, using machine learning techniques. This project will help in understanding customer 
behavior and determining key factors influencing churn. 
Project Steps: 
1. Data Acquisition: 
o Task: Obtain a dataset related to customer subscription services, such as telecom, 
streaming services, or software as a service (SaaS). Datasets like this are often 
available on platforms like Kaggle. 
2. Data Import and Export Using Pandas: 
o Task: Write a Python script to import the dataset using the Pandas library. 
Understand the structure of the data by examining rows, columns, and basic 
characteristics like data types and missing values. 
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
o Task: Conduct EDA to uncover patterns, spot anomalies, and form hypotheses 
about factors influencing customer churn. Utilize statistical summaries and 
visualizations to understand the dataâ€™s underlying distribution and relationships. 
4. Handling Missing Values and Outliers: 
o Task: Implement data cleaning techniques to handle missing values either by filling 
them with appropriate values or removing the rows/columns. Detect and manage 
outliers in the dataset to prevent skewed results. 
5. Feature Engineering and Encoding: 
o Task: Create new features that might help in predicting churn more accurately. 
Apply one-hot encoding to categorical variables to make them suitable for 
modeling. 
6. Feature Scaling: 
o Task: Standardize or normalize numerical features to ensure that the model does 
not become biased towards variables with higher magnitude. 
7. Dimensionality Reduction Using PCA: 
o Task: Apply PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, especially if there are 
many features, to improve model performance and reduce computational cost. 
8. Handling Imbalanced Data: 
o Task: Since churn datasets are typically imbalanced, apply techniques such as 
SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) or adjust class weights to 
manage the imbalance before training the model. 
9. Model Building: 
o Task: Use machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, random forest, or 
gradient boosting to build a model that can predict customer churn. Evaluate models 
based on appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, recall, F1-score). 
10. Data Visualization: 
o Task: Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations that summarize the 
findings and model performance, such as ROC curves, confusion matrices, and 
feature importance charts. 
11. Model Deployment: 
o Task: Prepare the model for deployment in a simulated production environment 
where stakeholders can input customer data and receive churn predictions. 
12. Documentation and Reporting: 
o Task: Document the entire process, including data sources, data description, 
insights gained, model choice rationale, performance metrics, and potential uses of 
the model in business strategy.
